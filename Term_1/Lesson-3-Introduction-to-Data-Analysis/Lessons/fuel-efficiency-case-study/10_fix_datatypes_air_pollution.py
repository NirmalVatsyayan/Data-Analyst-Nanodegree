# # Fixing `air_pollution_score` Data Type
# - 2008: convert string to float

# In[ ]:


# try using Pandas to_numeric or astype function to convert the
# 2008 air_pollution_score column to float -- this won't work


# # Figuring out the issue
# Looks like this isn't going to be as simple as converting the datatype. According to the error above, the value at row 582 is "6/4" - let's check it out.

# In[2]:


df_08.iloc[582]


# # It's not just the air pollution score!
# The mpg columns and greenhouse gas scores also seem to have the same problem - maybe that's why these were all saved as strings! According to [this link](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacarhelp.shtml#airPollutionScore), which I found from the PDF documentation:
# 
#     "If a vehicle can operate on more than one type of fuel, an estimate is provided for each fuel type."
#     
# Ohh.. so all vehicles with more than one fuel type, or hybrids, like the one above (it uses ethanol AND gas) will have a string that holds two values - one for each. This is a little tricky, so I'm going to show you how to do it with the 2008 dataset, and then you'll try it with the 2018 dataset.

# In[3]:


# First, let's get all the hybrids in 2008
hb_08 = df_08[df_08['fuel'].str.contains('/')]
hb_08


# Looks like this dataset only has one! The 2018 has MANY more - but don't worry - the steps I'm taking here will work for that as well!

# In[17]:


# hybrids in 2018
hb_18 = df_18[df_18['fuel'].str.contains('/')]
hb_18


# We're going to take each hybrid row and split them into two new rows - one with values for the first fuel type (values before the "/"), and the other with values for the second fuel type (values after the "/"). Let's separate them with two dataframes!

# In[5]:


# create two copies of the 2008 hybrids dataframe
df1 = hb_08.copy()  # data on first fuel type of each hybrid vehicle
df2 = hb_08.copy()  # data on second fuel type of each hybrid vehicle

# Each one should look like this
df1


# For this next part, we're going use Pandas' apply function. See the docs [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html).

# ### Split values for `fuel`, `city_mpg`, `hwy_mpg`, `cmb_mpg`
