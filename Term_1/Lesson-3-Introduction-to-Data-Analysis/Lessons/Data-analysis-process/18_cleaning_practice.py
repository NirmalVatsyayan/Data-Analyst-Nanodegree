# # Cleaning Practice
# Let's first practice handling missing values and duplicate data with `cancer_data_means.csv`.

# In[15]:


# import pandas and load cancer data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("cancer_data_means.csv")

# check which columns have missing values with info()
df.info()


# In[18]:


# use means to fill in missing values

# confirm your correction with info()

# ## Renaming Columns
# Since we also previously changed our dataset to only include means of tumor features, the "_mean" at the end of each feature seems unnecessary. It just takes extra time to type in our analysis later. Let's come up with a list of new labels to assign to our columns.

# In[31]:


# remove "_mean" from column names
new_labels = []
for col in df.columns:
    if '_mean' in col:
        new_labels.append(col[:-5])  # exclude last 6 characters
    else:
        new_labels.append(col)

# new labels for our columns
new_labels


# In[32]:


# assign new labels to columns in dataframe
df.columns = new_labels

# display first few rows of dataframe to confirm changes
